defmodule Phoenix.Socket.Transport do
  @moduledoc """
  API for building transports.

  This module describes what is required to build a Phoenix transport.
  The transport sits between the socket and channels, forwarding client
  messages to channels and vice-versa.

  A transport is responsible for:

    * Implementing the transport behaviour
    * Establishing the socket connection
    * Handling of incoming messages
    * Handling of outgoing messages
    * Managing channels
    * Providing secure defaults

  ## The transport behaviour

  The transport requires one function:

    * `default_config/0` - returns the default transport configuration
      to be merged when the transport is declared in the socket module

  ## Socket connections

  Once a connection is established, the transport is responsible
  for invoking the `Phoenix.Socket.connect/2` callback and acting
  accordingly. Once connected, the transport should request the
  `Phoenix.Socket.id/1` and subscribe to the topic if one exists.
  On subscribed, the transport must be able to handle "disconnect"
  broadcasts on the given id topic.

  The `connect/6` function in this module can be used as a
  convenience or a documentation on such steps.

  ## Incoming messages

  Incoming messages are encoded in whatever way the transport
  chooses. Those messages must be decoded in the transport into a
  `Phoenix.Socket.Message` before being forwarded to a channel.

  Most of those messages are user messages except:

    * "heartbeat" events in the "phoenix" topic - should just emit
      an OK reply
    * "phx_join" on any topic - should join the topic
    * "phx_leave" on any topic - should leave the topic

  The function `dispatch/3` can be used to handle these messages.

  ## Outgoing messages

  Channels can send two types of message back to a transport:
  `Phoenix.Socket.Message` and `Phoenix.Socket.Reply`. Those
  messages are encoded in the channel into a format defined by
  the transport. That's why transports are required to pass a
  serializer that abides to the behaviour described in
  `Phoenix.Transports.Serializer`.

  ## Managing channel exits

  Because channels are spawned from the transport process, transports
  must trap exits and correctly handle the `{:EXIT, _, _}` messages
  arriving from channels, relaying the proper response to the client.

  The `"phx_error"` event is sent by the transport when a channel exits,
  and represents the channel terminating against its will. The
  `on_exit_message/3` function aids in constructing the `"phx_error"` message.

  For graceful exits, the channel will notify the transort it is
  gracefully terminating via the following message:

      {:graceful_exit, channel_pid, %Phoenix.Socket.Message{}}

  The `%Phoenix.Socket.Message{}` is the leave message for the transport
  to relay to the client.

  ## Duplicate Join Subscriptions

  For a given topic, the client may only establish a single channel
  subscription. When attempting to create a duplicate subscription,
  `dispatch/3` will close the existing channel, log a warning, and
  spawn a new channel for the topic. When sending the `"phx_close"`
  event from the closed channel, the message will contain the `ref` the
  client sent when joining. This allows the client to uniquely identify
  `"phx_close"` and `"phx_error"` messages when force-closing a channel
  on duplicate joins.

  ## Security

  This module also provides functions to enable a secure environment
  on transports that, at some point, have access to a `Plug.Conn`.

  The functionality provided by this module helps in performing "origin"
  header checks and ensuring only SSL connections are allowed.

  ## Remote Client

  Channels can reply, synchronously, to any `handle_in/3` event. To match
  pushes with replies, clients must include a unique `ref` with every
  message and the channel server will reply with a matching ref where
  the client can pick up the callback for the matching reply.

  Phoenix includes a JavaScript client for WebSocket and Longpolling
  support using JSON encodings.

  Clients can be implemented for other protocols and encodings by
  abiding by the `Phoenix.Socket.Message` format.

  ## Protocol Versioning

  Clients are expected to send the Channel Transport protocol version that they
  expect to be talking to. The version can be retrieved on the server from
  `Phoenix.Channel.Transport.protocol_version/0`. If no version is provided, the
  Transport adapters should default to assume a `"1.0.0"` version number.
  See `web/static/js/phoenix.js` for an example transport client
  implementation.

  The following returns must be handled by transports:

  ## Parameter filtering on join

  When logging parameters, Phoenix can filter out sensitive parameters
  such as passwords and tokens. Parameters to be filtered can be added
  via the `:filter_parameters` option:

      config :phoenix, :filter_parameters, ["password", "secret"]

  With the configuration above, Phoenix will filter any parameter
  that contains the terms `password` or `secret`. The match is
  case sensitive.

  Phoenix's default is `["password"]`.
