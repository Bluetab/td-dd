# Changelog for v2.2

## Highlights

This release adds many improvements to Ecto with a handful of bug fixes. We recommend reading the full list of enhancements below. Here are some of the highlights.

Ecto now supports specifying fields sources. This is useful when you use a database with non-conventional names, such as uppercase letters or names with hyphens:

    field :name, :string, source: :NAME
    field :user_name, :string, source: :"user-name"

The source option can be specified programatically by given a function to `@field_source_mapper` that receives the field name as an atom and returns the source name as an atom.

On the migrations side, `execute/2` function was added, which allows developers to describe up and down commands inside the `change` callback:

    def change do
      execute "CREATE EXTENSION citext",
              "DROP EXTENSION citext"
    end

The `ecto.migrate` and `ecto.rollback` tasks have also been enhanced with the `--log-sql` option which is helpful when debugging errors or during deployments to keep track of your production database changes.

Ecto now will also warn at compile time of invalid relationships, such as a belongs_to that points to a schema that does not exist.

The query syntax also seen some improvements: map updates are supported in subqueries, the new `Ecto.Query.select_merge/3` makes it easier to write composable `select` clauses in queries and the `type/2` macro has been extended to support casting of fragments and fields in schemaless queries.

Finally, the UPSERT support added on Ecto v2.1 is getting more improvements: the `{:constraint, constraint}` is now supported as conflict target and the `:returning` option was added to `Ecto.Repo.insert/2`, mirroring the behaviour of `insert_all`.
